This was made using castledb, Castledb can be read through an addon, Or json. If you fork this! Please use one of them, We wanna go with reading them as json so we don't need a addon.

I have been trying to look into adding multiple (skill learn)'s in the players tab. They do not all have to work, But just making the functionality to earn skills with a specific level is needed.

All this stuff should be modified if you need to add or take away and unused parameter, I will however. Suggest changes or a clarification that something will be used because it is not used by you ## YET.
