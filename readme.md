## 3D Turn Based Battle System

Animation state's will be used for basic animation cycling, But for stuff like skill's. I thought about using the database approach! (This may not need to be enforced, But commenting on this can help me redact the: AnimationID, Meaning all animations will have to find their own name, And identifer in the animation state itself. [Could be easier])




These are using retargted animations, Just to show that they are possible with a 3d battle system like this.

## Project Description:
This battle system was gonna be used in my own projects, But as a collabrative effort, It will be open sourced, And maintained by the owner of this github repo. (The Game In Question Is Still In Development) [- Cute Fame 3D (Working Title)]
